# Ultrasonic Sensor Fix Summary

## Problems Identified:
1. **Serial Port Flooding**: The ultrasonic sensor was reading continuously in the main loop without any delay, sending data every iteration.
2. **No Timeout Handling**: The `pulseIn()` function could block indefinitely if the sensor didn't respond.
3. **Poor Error Handling**: No validation of sensor readings or error states.

## Changes Made:

### Arduino Code (espWorkProject_fixed.ino):

1. **Added Timing Control:**
   - Added `DISTANCE_READ_INTERVAL = 100ms` to read sensor only 10 times per second
   - Added `lastDistanceRead` timestamp tracking
   - Only reads sensor when enough time has passed

2. **Added Timeout Protection:**
   - Added `ULTRASONIC_TIMEOUT = 30000` microseconds (30ms)
   - This prevents `pulseIn()` from blocking forever
   - 30ms timeout equals about 5 meters max distance

3. **Improved Error Handling:**
   - Check if `pulseIn()` returns 0 (timeout)
   - Validate distance is within HC-SR04 range (2-400cm)
   - Send "Dist:ERROR" instead of invalid readings

4. **Fixed Trigger Pulse:**
   - Changed trigger pulse duration from 5μs to 10μs (standard for HC-SR04)

### Python Code (web_fixed.py):

1. **Added Error Message Handling:**
   - Check if received distance is "ERROR"
   - Set ultrasonic_distance to "N/A" for errors
   - Added debug messages for error states

2. **Improved Serial Communication:**
   - Added serial_lock usage when writing commands
   - Better exception handling in serial thread

## How to Use:

1. Upload the fixed Arduino code:
   ```bash
   # Use Arduino IDE or CLI to upload espWorkProject_fixed.ino to your ESP32
   ```

2. Run the fixed Python server:
   ```bash
   python3 web_fixed.py
   ```

3. The ultrasonic sensor should now:
   - Update every 100ms instead of continuously
   - Show "N/A" when sensor has errors
   - Not freeze or get stuck
   - Not flood the serial communication

## Testing:
- Check that distance readings update smoothly
- Block the sensor to test error handling
- Monitor console output for any error messages
